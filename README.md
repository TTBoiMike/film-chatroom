# Film Chatroom

This project is a film chatroom built using React, Express and Bootstrap, and uses a MongoDB database. The brief for this project was to create a social interaction application where users could post to a single feed and other users were able to interact with the posts by either liking and/or commenting.

### About the project

As someone who loves watching films the idea for this project stemmed from wanting to find out the best new films, TV shows and documentaries available to watch on the best streaming sites. The application allows users to create a post that recommends a programme or film to watch on a selection of streaming sites. Other uses are able to veiw all the recommended programmes and filter the feed by genere and streaming site so they can all view shows the have a subscription for.

I created this project using React and Bootstrap and added a MongoDB database. I also built the API using Express.js to provide data for the application. The code for this can be viewed on [this repo](https://github.com/TTBoiMike/film-chatroom-be).
